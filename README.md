# Reliance-Stock-Market-Prediction 
<p>I have created a <b>Stock Market Price Prediction</b> project that can predict the stock price of any company for the next 30 days. Here I used the last 7 years' data of Reliance Industries Limited.
  
# What we have to do in this Project:
<h3><b>Business Objective of the project</b></h3>

- Predict the Reliance Industries Stock Price for the next 30 days.

- There are Open, High, Low and Close prices that you need to obtain from the web for each day starting from 2015 to 2022 for Reliance Industries stock.

- Split the last year into a test set- to build a model to predict stock price.

- Find short term, & long term trends.

- Understand how it is impacted from external factors or any big external events.

- Forecast for next 30 days.
